    title: Our goals
    list:
      - define the metrics that drive sustained operational excellence
      - reduce energy consumption and carbon impact of the built environment
      - raise the standard for comfort and reliability
      - develop the workforce that can operate and maintain the building of the future
      - deliver an aggressive ROI that allows investment in future innovations
