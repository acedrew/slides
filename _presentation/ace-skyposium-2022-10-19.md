  title: Native API connector
  list:
    - None of us are Fantom or Axon devs
    - Would need to install and maintain in all customer environments
    - Backfilling and troubleshooting would have to be managed from client environments
    - Likely miss out on our evented architecture, resulting in higher API load

- format: list
  title: PySession/hxpy
  list:
    - Requires SkySpark to manage containers, not compatible with AWS Lambda or other FaaS infrastructure
    - If using pull, would need to deploy and manage container environments in customer sites
    - Not really the use case it was designed for, likely to encounter support issues
    - We really try to be open-first, customers should have choice, even if the best choice is SkySpark

  title: PyHaystack
  list:
    - Open Source! (by great people, shout-out Christian)
    - Standard Python runtime allows us to run anywhere Python is supported
    - Oriented around syncing metadata and bulk data import/export, not ideal for streaming
    - Broader use-case, meant to support multiple vendor's Haystack APIs, with various auth options
    - Initial implementation for a relatively small site resulted in 100s of API calls to SkySpark for each time-step

  list:
    - Open Source! (by ok people, shout-out us)
    - Standard Python runtime allows us to run anywhere Python is supported
    - Oriented around efficiently streaming time series data into SkySpark
    - Single purpose, meant to be useful to the SkySpark community without complexity of supporting broader ecosystem
    - Not intended as a monolith, composable architecture allows using the pieces you need and ignoring the rest

  title: "ace-skyspark future:"
  list:
    - Open Source! (contribute if you want) https://github.com/ACE-IoT-Solutions/ace-skyspark
    - Support more metadata synchronization options
    - Use Haxall/hxpy models
    - Include more direct support for Pandas/Numpy data structures
    - Open to better ways...
